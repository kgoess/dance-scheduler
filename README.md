BACDS dance schedule manager
----

https://bacds.org is the calendar authority for current events hosted by the
Bay Area Country Dance Society. This dance-scheduler comprises both an admin
app for managing dance series and events, based on the Dancer2 framework, and a
rewrite of the site based on the Unearth design from ColorLib dynamically served by the
same Dancer2 framework.

The sources for all this can be found in github https://github.com/kgoess/dance-scheduler

See that for documentation and schemas and more goodies.

Development
----

This app relies heavily on the Dancer2 project for the webapp infrastructure
and DBIx::Class for automating the relationship between the code and the
database schema.

    https://metacpan.org/dist/Dancer2/view/script/dancer2

    https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class

Any perl libs not available to centos-7 are in /var/lib/dance-scheduler,
so you'll want to run this before doing any dev

    eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=/var/lib/dance-scheduler)

After running that 'eval', new modules get installed there via cpanm, e.g.
"cpanm DBIx::Class"

The files in lib/bacds/Scheduler/Schema\* were generated via

    dbicdump -o dump_directory=./lib \
         -o components='["InflateColumn::DateTime"]' \
         -o debug=1 \
         -o skip_load_external=1 \
         bacds::Scheduler::Schema \
         'dbi:mysql:dbname=schedule_test' \
         scheduler_test \
         $(cat ~/.mysql-password)

To start up dancer2 serving the content in the git repo on port :5000, e.g.
http://www.bacds.org:5000/signin.html run this:

    plackup -Ilib -p 5000 bin/app.psgi

You'll probably want to run these so you can sign in to the test app:

    bin/dance-scheduler-add-programmer.pl --name 'Your Name' --email your@email.com --db schedule_test --dbuser scheduler_test
    bin/dance-scheduler-user-password.pl --email your@email.com --db schedule_test --dbuser scheduler_test
    > enter password:


Live and Test Databases
----

The live database is "schedule" with the user "scheduler", password is in
/var/www/bacds.org/dance-scheduler/private/. You can use
schemas/copy-prod-to-test.sh to dump that to a "schedule_test" database
accessible with the user "scheduler_test". If you use plackup to run a local
copy of the app on like port 5000, it'll be using "schedule_test".

How to Access the Databases

The test database:

    mysql -uscheduler_test --password=`cat ~/.mysql-password` schedule_test \
        --default-character-set=utf8mb4  \
        --pager='less -SX'

The real production database:

    mysql -uscheduler --password=`cat /var/www/bacds.org/dance-scheduler/private/mysql-password` schedule \
        --default-character-set=utf8mb4  \
        --pager='less -SX'

How To Make Schema Changes
----

1) Run schemas/copy-prod-to-test.sh
2) Make your table changes in "schedule_test"
3) In this git repo, run that "eval" and "dbicdump" command in the
   "Development" section above, that will generate new the perl code.
4) Update the relevant files in the "schemas/" directory.
5) Make the appropriate changes in accordions-webui.yml for your new field.
6) Add the field to the appropriate file in lib/bacds/Scheduler/Model/, see
   get_fields_for_input and get_fields_for_output.
7) Run "plackup -Ilib -p 5000 bin/app.psgi" and you can test your change at
   http://bacds.org:5000 (note http not https).
8) Run "make test" (see the "Install" section below for details) to see any
   changes needed in the unit tests and fix them up until they pass.
9) Then see the "Install" section below.
10) ...and coordinate that with repeating your schema changes in the live
   "schedule" database.


Install
----

    # unless you ran it already:
    eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=/var/lib/dance-scheduler)

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    # or make test HARNESS_OPTIONS=j3 (there are only 2 cores on the fried VPS,
    # so "3" is the best speedup you'll get)

    # install the libraries to /var/lib/dance-scheduler
    make install

    # install the rest of the dancer2 app to /var/www/bacds.org/dance-scheduler
    make app-install

    # optional, the only one that requires sudo
    # install the dance-scheduler.conf to /etc/httpd/conf.d/
    sudo make httpd-conf-install

    sudo service httpd restart

(Those last two, "make app-install" and "make httpd-conf-install/" will be
replaced by rpm .spec files eventually. Keeping it this way for now so that we
can iterate more easily during development.)

Login
----

So that we don't have to manage passwords for users, and worry about weak
passwords and all that, we added a login-with button for Facebook and Google.
If a user has command-line access at the server they can run the user-password
utility and login with a password.
