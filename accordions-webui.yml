        This is for things like special events where there are too many bands
        and talent for the regular display logic to make sense. If you put anything in
        this field it will replace the default "at &lt;location&gt;. &lt;caller1, caller2&gt; with
        &lt;band1, band2&gt; music by &lt;muso1, muso2&gt;" on the main listing on the front page.

        Generally the homepage will display the event with photos of the

        poster from the event rather than pictures of the talent.
