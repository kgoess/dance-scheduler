I'd like to suggest that in the new schema we add a way to, per entry,  put the
formatted output desired into one column and then just dump it out in
dancefinder or specialevents.  That would give us maximum flexibility for this
kind of request.  We could either add a column that does that, if ticked, or
just go by there being any value in that column.)

I'd like to split the "performer_url" into "leader_url" and "band_url" because
the usual case is that they are different. I'd also like to add "leader_photo"
and "band_photo" which would be the URL of a nice photo for each, if they
exist. We should look at all the current abuses of the "band" field and try to
get them moved to separate fields.

county for series/event? link to covid policies?

should events.start_time be not-null? what about camps?

phase I:
 DONE events just needs a short desc
 DONE series needs a short desc for the top of the page, and an optional long desc
   for the body, see sf contra currently
 DONE series needs a sidebar field (big textbox)
 DONE location also needs a sidebar field for the series pages and for the
   /directions/ page (ultimately)
 DONE dance cancelled
 NOPE make start/end times raw text, just "times" like "dance is from 6 to 7 with
   food in the middle"
 - work out authentication
 - work out that is_deleted field--it shouldn't be exposed (there should be a
   'delete' button), and it should do something on the backend
 DONE add description to venue list, not just the three-letter thing
 - sort out abuse of the 'band' column
 DONE event.name on the UI use event.name if present otherwise generate one
 - return a fresh object from the db, not the one that was submitted
 - find other TODOs/FIXMEs in the code
 - set up in apache
 DONE add leader_url and band_url to bands (performer_url isn't currently used
   anywhere)
 DONE add photo_url to talent
 - need an event url for display in https://bacds.org/scripts/dancefinder.pl,
   called out by Alan's change 904dd65c6e832 in
   git:/var/lib/git/bacds.org-scripts/
 - add a "pricing" textbox to events
 - add "manager name" to series
 - fill in TOS, privacy urls from google auth
 - merge to master

phase II:

 - handle server errors better than an alert box
 - make /directions/content.html a dynamic page
 - the listbox showing existing things would be completely retooled, with
   filtering and who knows
