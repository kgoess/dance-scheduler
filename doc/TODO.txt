I'd like to suggest that in the new schema we add a way to, per entry,  put the
formatted output desired into one column and then just dump it out in
dancefinder or specialevents.  That would give us maximum flexibility for this
kind of request.  We could either add a column that does that, if ticked, or
just go by there being any value in that column.)

I'd like to split the "performer_url" into "leader_url" and "band_url" because
the usual case is that they are different. I'd also like to add "leader_photo"
and "band_photo" which would be the URL of a nice photo for each, if they
exist. We should look at all the current abuses of the "band" field and try to
get them moved to separate fields.

county for series/event? link to covid policies?

should events.start_time be not-null? what about camps?

phase I:
 DONE events just needs a short desc
 DONE series needs a short desc for the top of the page, and an optional long desc
   for the body, see sf contra currently
 DONE series needs a sidebar field (big textbox)
 DONE location also needs a sidebar field for the series pages and for the
   /directions/ page (ultimately)
 DONE dance cancelled
 NOPE make start/end times raw text, just "times" like "dance is from 6 to 7 with
   food in the middle"
 DONE add description to venue list, not just the three-letter thing
 DONE event.name on the UI use event.name if present otherwise generate one
 DONE add leader_url and band_url to bands (performer_url isn't currently used
   anywhere)
 DONE add photo_url to talent
 DONE set up in apache
 DONE- merge to master
 - work out authentication
 - work out that is_deleted field--it shouldn't be exposed (there should be a
   'delete' button), and it should do something on the backend
 - sort out abuse of the 'band' column
 - find other TODOs/FIXMEs in the code
 DONE need an event url for display in https://bacds.org/scripts/dancefinder.pl,
   called out by Alan's change 904dd65c6e832 in
   git:/var/lib/git/bacds.org-scripts/
 DONE add a "pricing" textbox to events
 DONE add "manager name" to series
 - talk about "sidebar", see a47b7c918239
    -- add "directions" field to venues
    -- create "pricing" table that maps to events
    -- create a sidebar options table that links to events, to allow including and sorting options as desired
 - fill in TOS, privacy urls from google auth
   for their page "Confirm you want to sign in to "bacds.org" as Bob
   bob@foo.com. To create your account, Google will share your name, email
   address, and profile picture with bacds.org. See bacds.org's "privacy policy"
   and "terms of service""
 - make the UI clear which fields are required and which are optional
 - add "help" buttons to the UI?
 DONE need CLI tool for password management
 - need permissions to edit a standalone event without a series
 - fill in the 401 unauthorized error page 401.html
 DONE care that they're logged in
 DONE hook up the bacds login form
 DONE CLI utility to manage username/pw
 - find docs on google/facebook to change them from redirects to something else
 - then change our js to pop up a modal and follow that new flow
 - add handler for the 403 "you don't have permission" and let them continue
 - is_superuser is saying "yes" even when it's not

phase II:

 - handle server errors better than an alert box
 - make /directions/content.html a dynamic page
 - the listbox showing existing things would be completely retooled, with
   filtering and who knows
 - CALDAV output
